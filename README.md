# Grokking Deep Learning Rust

The exercises from the @iamtrask book [Grokking Deep Learning](https://manning.com/books/grokking-deep-learning) implemented in rust.

This crate is structured as a library, with the core library describing some common primitives used throughout and the individual chapters implemented in the exercises. To run the exercises from a particular chapter, for example chapter 12

```
cargo run --example chapter12
```

Currently this uses [rulinalg](https://docs.rs/rulinalg) for matrix operations, which uses a Rust implementation of `dgemm` and provides a 3x performance over normal ijk multiplication (see included benchmark). However, it still isn't as fast as numpy because it isn't multi-threaded. Currently working on something of my own.

As a result of slower matmul, chapter 8 onwards, certain examples are smaller in size compared to the python examples.
